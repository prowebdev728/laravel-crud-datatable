We would like to implement a table for displaying information from our application. Our current recommendation is https://editor.datatables.net/ however we are happy to consider alternative tools that can provide the same functionality.

• Client read/write via an AJAX API
• Laravel 5.3 and MySQL backend
• Search based on data in the row
• Ability to sort by column
• Change sequence of rows
• Save changes to the database
• Add Button that loads modal form and adds a row to the datatable
• Edit button that allows all the fields to be modified (can be modal or redirect to a new page)
• Implement Excel, PDF, Print and CSV buttons (listed in sequence of priority for code implementation)
• Use a bootstrap base style sheet

Can provide sample data or can be implemented with an example data set and we will migrate it to the multiple pages once the Proof of Concept is successfully completed.

Please spend 10 hours on this, then we will review your progress and determine if we would like to continue.
