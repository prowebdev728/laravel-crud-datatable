We would like to implement a table for displaying information from our application. Our current recommendation is https://editor.datatables.net/

• Client read/write via an AJAX API

• Laravel 5.3 and MySQL backend

• Search based on data in the row

• Ability to sort by column

• Change sequence of rows

• Save changes to the database

• Add Button that loads modal form and adds a row to the datatable

• Edit button that allows all the fields to be modified (can be modal or redirect to a new page)

• Implement Excel, PDF, Print and CSV buttons (listed in sequence of priority for code implementation)

• Use a bootstrap base style sheet
